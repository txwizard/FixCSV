# FixCSV Change Log

##2021/01/02 Version 1.3

included herein.

##2021/01/02 Version 1.2

## 2020/10/12 Version 1.1

1. Add a help message when the name of the input file is omitted.

2. Fix a bug exposed by attempting to process a CSV generated by ZOOMINFO.

3. Compensate for a quirk seen in the ZOOMINFO export, and elsewhere from time
to time. The quirk is that the file contains a quirky double line break,
0d 0d 0a. That's a legacy Macintosh line break, followed by a Windows line
break.

# 2020/09/07 Version 1.0

This is the initial implementation, a Minimum Viable Product that meets the
immediate need that motivated its creation.
